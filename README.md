Hello, my name is Kayla Cooper.

I come from a small town in Lambton County called Alvinston, also known as the boonies...

 I am taking Interactive Media Design, and I am looking forward to finding innovative ways to integrate the skills I learn from this course into my passion for Art, music, photography, and videography.
